        "description": "This project aimed to research selenium/cypress (UI testing frameworks) for replacing some if not all of the manual regression tests that Taq has to do every time they deploy something to production. I was responsible for making a document and sample code comparing the two frameworks with their pros/cons. I did this project between the periods when I was assigned no other task. In this, I used my prior programming skills to analyze the speed, simplicity (coding syntax), and company constraints to successfully make a judgment between these two frameworks. I received good feedback from 2 of the developers at Taq including my team lead. My research was then ultimately used as the key factor in deciding which framework to use. With this, I learned how to research and understand key indicators as to which frameworks would be the best at a given company.",

        "description": "In this project, I developed a JavaScript tool for Adobe Acrobat that streamlined document processing, achieving a 50% reduction in processing time. My responsibility was to create a tool that automated several routine tasks, leveraging my programming skills to enhance efficiency. During periods when I was not assigned to other tasks, I focused on this initiative, applying my knowledge of JavaScript to solve practical problems faced by our team. My solution received positive feedback from my team lead and other developers, notably for its impact on reducing manual labor and speeding up workflows. This experience taught me how to effectively apply technical skills to improve business processes and significantly cut down on operational delays.",
