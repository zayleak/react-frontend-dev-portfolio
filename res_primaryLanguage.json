        "description": "This project aimed to research selenium/cypress (UI testing frameworks) for replacing some if not all of the manual regression tests that Taq has to do every time they deploy something to production. I was responsible for making a document and sample code comparing the two frameworks with their pros/cons. I did this project between the periods when I was assigned no other task. In this, I used my prior programming skills to analyze the speed, simplicity (coding syntax), and company constraints to successfully make a judgment between these two frameworks. I received good feedback from 2 of the developers at Taq including my team lead. My research was then ultimately used as the key factor in deciding which framework to use. With this, I learned how to research and understand key indicators as to which frameworks would be the best at a given company.",
